# Hopefully you enjoyed the VMS training!  

As discussed in the training, I suggest using the Aqua Landing app to launch Visitor Management System (VMS).

Below are the steps to install the Aqua Landing App I showed in training. This app allows easily access the Visitor Management System (VMS) as well as other Aqua apps!

1.	Click on [this link](aqualanding.application) to save & open (see below)
<br/><b>- Click "Save" to download file to <i>Downloads</i> folder.</b>
