# Hopefully you enjoyed the VMS training  today!  

As discussed in the training, I suggest using the Aqua Landing app to launch Visitor Management System (VMS).

Below are the steps to install the Aqua Landing App I showed in training. This app allows easily access the Visitor Management System (VMS) as well as other Aqua apps!

1.	Click on this link & click “Yes” to continue if prompted
2.	Click Install button  (see below)
 
3.	After Aqua Landing is installed, I suggest pin to your taskbar (see below)
 

If you have any questions let me know.
